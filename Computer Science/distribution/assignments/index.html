Links to individual questions are in the sidebar to the left. Some questions may
require Internet access to properly display embedded mathematics; if there is no Internet
access, the mathematical notation should still be readable in text form.</p><p>All questions are to be done individually unless otherwise specified.
Please do not consult books, papers, or Web pages.
Do not look at the code of other students, or show your code to other students.
You may discuss assignment questions with other students at a high level,
but please do not take any notes during these discussions.
If you run into difficulties, ask me (the instructor) or the tutors for help.</p><p>When I teach this material over twelve weeks in Canada, I use a server to which students
submit assignment solutions. The server tests student programs using test expressions
that are unknown to the students. In a few minutes after submission, the student
receives a report that either says that their program passed all tests, or lists
the numbers of the first two tests that failed. This does not provide much information.
It only says that the submitted program is not fully correct.
Students are supposed to write their own tests.
Furthermore, each student can only submit three times in any 24-hour period.</p><p>Because the AIMS course is only three weeks long, and because the server is located in Canada,
I am not using it. Instead, for each assignment question, I have written a evaluation program
containing the test expressions. You will be provided with a copy of this program,
which has been compiled so that it is no longer a text file,
and the test expressions are not visible. Please do not try to discover the
test expressions, or use this file in any way other than as described below.
Note that the evaluation program only checks this limited form of technical correctness.
Some questions ask you to follow a certain style, or to use only certain features of Racket.
The evaluation program will not enforce this.
You must submit a final version of your program to the tutors before the assignment deadline,
and the tutors may deduct marks if your program fails to meet the specifications
in the question, even if it is technically correct.</p><p>Lecture module 02 describes the <span style="font-weight: bold">design recipe</span>, a method of designing and testing
functions. Please follow this for all assignment questions. Not only does this help
you to do your work, it provides us with valuable information in the case
that you come to us for assistance. Once you have thoroughly
tested your assignment solution, you can check it against the evaluation program as follows.
(The example below is for Question 1; simply change the number for subsequent questions.)</p><p>Your solution to Question 1 will be in the file <span class="stt">Q1.rkt</span>. The associated testing program
is called <span class="stt">Q1-test_rkt.zo</span>. Move this file into the same folder as your solution.
Also move the file <span class="stt">Q1-eval.rkt</span> into this folder.
This is the evaluation program.
Then use DrRacket to open <span class="stt">Q1-eval.rkt</span>.
You should see the following two lines:</p><blockquote class="SCodeFlow"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="RktBlk"><tr><td><span class="RktPn">(</span><span class="RktSym">require</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">"Q1-test_rkt.zo"</span><span class="RktPn">)</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="RktPn">(</span><span class="RktSym">run-tests</span><span class="RktPn">)</span></td></tr></table></blockquote><p>Run <span class="stt">Q1-eval.rkt</span> in DrRacket.
You should get a report in the Interactions window. Unlike with the Canadian server
described above, you will see the results of all tests. There is also no restriction
on how often or how frequently you can run a testing program. Please try to use it
as little as possible. When it says you have an error, think carefully about your program,
and write more tests of your own, rather than quickly making a change and then trying
the evaluation program again.</p><p>Here are the possible test results reported by the evaluation program:</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">"Success: test passed"</span>.
You can congratulate yourself for this one.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">"Error: wrong result for test"</span>.
This usually means that our test expression
did not produce the expected value
when evaluated using your program.
It can also happen with some assignment questions if
your program was supposed to deliberately raise an error
with my test expression, but it did not.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">"Error: program ran out of resources while running test"</span>.
This means that your program took too much time or too much memory during the test.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">"Error: program encountered error while running test"</span>.
This means that your program halted with an error during the evaluation
of a test expression, but it wasn&rsquo;t supposed to.
One very simple reason could be that you have made a spelling mistake,
so the function expected by the test expression is not defined in your program.
This error can also happen if the evaluation of the test expression was supposed to
halt with an error or raise an error, and it did,
but the error message did not match the assignment specification.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">"Error: program ran out of time while initializing"</span>.
This happens if your program takes too much time
when it is evaluated by the testing program,
before any tests are run.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">"Error: program ran out of memory while initializing"</span>.
Same as above, but with memory. This is rare.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">"Error: program failed to initialize"</span>.
This can happen if your program has a runtime error when run in DrRacket.
If that doesn&rsquo;t happen when you run your program yourself,
it usually means that you have used the wrong language level.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="nonavigation">&larr; prev</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="nonavigation">up</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Question_1.html" title="forward to &quot;1 Question 1&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
