ERRORS IN ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS

Question 1: "middle-of-three" should be "middle-of-3"


ERRORS IN SLIDES

Module 3:

Slides 15, 16, 18:

true and false are being used as values in the slides, and they should
be replaced by #true and #false.

Slides 15, 16, 17: 

Add the following to the substitution rules for cond:

Substitution in a cond expression is only possible in the leftmost
clause (question-answer pair). No subexpressions in clauses after the
first can be rewritten.

Another possible fix for this error is to say that the leftmost
OUTERMOST subexpression to which a rule applies should be
rewritten. That also results in the trace on slide 19 being correct.

Module 2:

The answers in the Boolean expression exercises are correct, but the
traces explaining the answers are not correct. The traces in the
slides evaluate all arguments, but "and" and "or" are forms that might
not evaluate all arguments. Exercise: fix the traces using the rules
from Module 3.
